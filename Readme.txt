This is an automated script for pushing and pulling git repos.
I have also made an install script that installs the program to its own folder in user documents.
Currently, only master branch is supported.

Usage:
All you need to do is to run the install script and it will present you with options. It will create a folder
called git-pull in documents which will also include a .bat file. For simplicity, whenever you want to run the program,
you can just run that. You can configure and uninstall all the files from install.py again if you desire to do so.
